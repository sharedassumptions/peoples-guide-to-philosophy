# A People's Guide to Philosophy

What is philosophy? As a first stab, we can say that philosophy is the area of study concerned with principles that apply across many different domains of life, with fundamental and general questions about life, and with questions that can't be answered by any established methodology.

Modern life is built on increasingly complex systems of thought, technology, culture, and social organization. The construction and maintenance of these systems depends on human thought and decision making.

Human thought and decision making is almost invariably based on principles of reasoning, and also on values. Principles of reasoning help us determine what is and what might be. Given knowledge of what is and what might be, values guide us in deciding what we should strive to make so.

Philosophy is concerned with the principles of reasoning that apply in all areas of life. It's also concerned with the process of formulating and refining the values which we apply in making decisions in all areas of life.

People's economic and social existences depend on knowledge, and they always have. Hunter-gatherers employ knowledge as part of various practices to secure food, solve basic problems of living, organize themselves, and experience meaning in life, among other things. In industrial and post-industrial life, we use knowledge to solve the same problems (and many other problems) in more complex ways. Individuals, businesses, governments, and organizations employ increasingly complex knowledge to perform their increasingly complex work.

Philosophy lies at the root of human knowledge. Systematically successful development of knowledge depends on adherence to principles which result in systematic (if imperfect) correspondence of beliefs with the truth. The principles which produce this outcome are one of the primary things we will pursue in this book.

The principles I articulate in this book mostly aren't original to me. Most of them are widely agreed upon and uncontroversial. However, writing a book like this does require a lot of synthesis. All blame for error in this book goes to me. All credit goes by default to those I've learned from, but it's possible that some of what I say is original.

It can be debated whether there are really principles of reasoning that apply in all areas of life, which are objectively correct, which lead us to the truth, and so forth. There are many complex discussions to be had in this area, and we will have many of them. For now, we'll point out that human achievements provide proof of our ability to reason successfully, and they illustrate how we are able to do so.

Our ability to construct complex, delicate systems which function correctly, such as computer systems, space vehicles, etc., illustrates our ability to reason successfully. Anyone who has programmed computers knows that a tiny error in a computer program often causes it to fail dramatically. Humans write computer programs containing millions of lines of code, in a medium where each small error is likely to cause dramatic failure, and many of these programs have few enough errors that they work very reliably. Such results aren't achieved by trial and error; they're achieved by humans using successful, reliable, repeatable reasoning techniques to construct programs which they can reasonably believe will run successfully based on their understanding of what they've done. In every field of engineering, people achieve success working under the same kinds of error-prone conditions, using the same principles of reasoning. Explaining and documenting the techniques that produce such success is one of the jobs of philosophy.

Of course, some might accept the importance of general principles of reasoning in engineering, and yet reject their importance in other domains, such as politics or philosophy. One might accept that general principles of reasoning have something to offer in explaining the foundations of engineering practices, while rejecting that general principles of reasoning have much to offer for understanding and navigating softer domains of life, such as personal development, social relationships, politics, and spirituality. The foundational principles of formal logic, mathematics, probabilistic reasoning, etc. which are so relevant to engineering are not so clearly useful in softer domains. My belief is that these "sharp" tools which are so effective for investigating engineering problems don't have quite the right shape for attacking soft problems; but that returning to the philosophical fundamentals which produce these principles allows us to make progress on understanding the principles governing reasoning about softer problems as well.

There are many forms of reason-skepticism, and we can't hope to address them all here. In this book we aim to address reason-skepticism primarily by making the positive case that there is a study of general principles of reasoning; that this study has established agreed upon results which are correct as far as they go; that the fruits of this study are not yet as widely appreciated as they ought to be; that this study makes progress over time; that there is more to discover; and that this study has significant value to provide for solving soft problems as well as hard problems.

The part of this that is most significant and hardest to substantiate, in my opinion, is that the study of principles of reasoning has value for solving soft problems. In politics, for example, there are some who think that rational debate can't solve political issues and isn't the way we should solve political issues. One of the moral stances I aim to substantiate is that rational debate based on philosophically sound reasoning is, always has been, and always must be, central to healthy, functional democratic politics.

The value of philosophy isn't something I necessarily expect to convince you of in the introduction to this book (if you don't believe in it already). The way you can prove to yourself that philosophy is valuable is by applying the principles of philosophy to problems in your life and seeing what happens. We'll also talk now in generalities about ways in which philosophy is applicable to common situations in life.

Philosophy is valuable for our self-improvement and the pursuit of our objectives for ourselves. We can best succeed in life by having a clear conception of what we value, and by formulating rational plans to pursue what we value. We can best succeed in life by analyzing ourselves and the consequences of our actions in order to arrive at actionable conclusions about how we can best pursue self-improvement and how we can act more effectively in the world. Philosophy gives us tools which help us to do all these things.

Philosophy is also valuable for improving and sustaining our relationships with others. In human relationships there are usually disagreements, and these are most likely to reach a peaceful, productive solution when addressed through reasonable discussion. Therefore having a solid grasp of good principles of reasoning, as part of the general principles and etiquette of constructive communication and conflict resolution, should help us to sustain harmonious and successful relationships with others.

Having a solid grasp of our values also helps us in our relationships with others. We can approach moral disagreements more effectively when we understand our own values; understand and respect that others hold different values; and have an interest in understanding the values of others as a basis for constructive discussion.

A simple example of how we can apply philosophy is in understanding the *sources* of disagreements we have with others.

1. Many disagreements turn out to be illusory disagreements caused by the participants in a discussion differently understanding the meaning of language being used, so that some party thinks another party is saying something they're not trying to say. These so-called disagreements are often called [``verbal disputes.''](http://philosophy.hku.hk/think/meaning/verbal.php) Of course there may be no real disagreement present in these cases; often there's only an appearance of disagreement created by miscommunication.
2. Other disagreements are caused by the participants possessing different information.
3. Other disagreements arise when the participants may possess the same information, but interpret it differently, in terms of its evidentiary significance for some conclusion(s) in question.
4. Other disagreements arise when the participants may possess the same information and agree on how to interpret its evidentiary significance, but they still disagree because they possess different values or they apply their values to the case in different ways.

Each of these types of disagreement requires a different approach. A good general tactic for solving disagreements is to try to identify the reason(s) for the disagreement. A workable first approach to doing that is to proceed roughly down this list. First, is it clear that all parties understand what the others are saying? Second, have the parties shared the relevant information that is the basis of their opinion? Third, do they agree how this information should be interpreted, in terms of its evidentiary significance? Or, is the disagreement based on differences in values, so that it would remain even if sources 1-3 of disagreement were ruled out?

Obviously no linear, formulaic process is going to be an ideal approach to discussion. Discussion is a highly non-linear and creative process. So these suggestions should be taken in a non-definitive and flexible way.

Let us now move past the personal and interpersonal areas of life to consider philosophy's applicability to almost everything else.



So far we've discussed in some depth what philosophy can be used for, and why you should care to finish this book. Let's now return to our original question: what is philosophy?

"Philosophy" is a term whose origins go back to Ancient Greece, where Socrates and his followers were the first to my knowledge to call themselves philosophers. "Philosophy" comes from the Greek *philosophia*, often translated as "love of wisdom." In subsequent times, "philosophy" came to refer to all areas of knowledge, from mathematics to occult magic. 

In modern times, ``philosophy'' commonly refers to the academic field of philosophy. The academic field of philosophy emerged as a distinct entity, with a distinct set of problems assigned to it, as a consequence of academic professionalization and specialization with the rise of the Western research university.

Philosophy has common usages that don't clearly fit any of the foregoing models. Certain discussions are called philosophical discussions. One can have a philosophical discussion about almost anything. For example, have you ever tried asking a group of English speakers whether a hot dog is a kind of sandwich? In my experience, regardless of the age or philosophical training of the participants, one will likely provoke a lively discussion deploying philosophical principles of argumentation.

For example, one can argue that a hot dog is not a sandwich because hot dogs have a hinge. One can postulate the generalization that to be a sandwich, a food item must consist of foodstuff between two disconnected pieces of bread. This raises the question of the open-faced sandwich. If you accept that an open-faced sandwich is a kind of sandwich, then you must reject the principle that a sandwich needs to consist of foodstuff between two disconnected pieces of bread.

Let's try to defend the position that a hot dog is a sandwich. This position avoids the difficulties described in the previous paragraph, so maybe it appears attractive at this point. However, if we allow that a hot dog is a sandwich, we're led to ask, is a burrito a sandwich? Is a taco a sandwich? Both food items are similar to hot dogs in many respects. Perhaps we can exclude them by stipulating that a sandwich needs to have as its enclosing food a form of risen bread.

Of course, the whole question is a waste of time. It's entertaining to talk about, but it's purely a dispute over the meaning of words. There is no authority over language, and ultimately people can use words however they want to. Since language use is a matter of free choice, it's usually unproductive to legislate about how words should be used.

There are exceptions to this. Many technical terms have established meanings which should be adhered to for compelling reasons. For example, ``inch'' denotes a certain length. Suppose one flouted convention by manufacturing a ruler which was marked in inches, but where the lengths marked as inches were not actually near to the (conventional, agreed upon) length of an inch. This would be regarded as a condemnable practice which could result in significant damages to people by causing construction and engineering projects to go awry.

As another example, the U.S. Constitution specifies that the President may appoint the members of their Cabinet with the ``advice and consent'' of the Senate. In legal contexts, as for example in determining whether that provision of the Constitution was followed in a particular instance, the traditional, established legal meaning of the phrase bears a special importance.

In the case of the term ``sandwich,'' no such considerations apply. There is no definitive argument for or against calling a hot dog a sandwich, because there is no set of rules and no governing authority which could legislate this question and produce a definitive answer.

Moreover, it's not important. Words are tools we use to communicate and thereby live our lives. Since words are tools, when we run into difficulties which are created solely by the words we're using, we're simply misusing our tools.

The debate about whether a hot dog is a sandwich is a game of entertainment whose playing pieces are tools that were originally meant for the practical purpose of describing kinds of food to each other in order to be able to plan meals, order food, and so forth. ``Is a hot dog a sandwich?'' is not a question about the world, or even really a question about social conventions. It's a question about linguistic categories, to which there is no definitive answer.

Most everybody has probably found themselves in this kind of debate over terms at some point in their life. This is an example of a kind of philosophical debate that people commonly have, in the modern world outside of academic institutions.

Philosophy also has a broader and deeper place in most of our lives. Most people probably have some philosophical stances on political issues, on moral issues concerning how people should behave, on religious issues, and so forth.

It's not obvious how to describe the underlying principle (if there is one) behind our application of the adjective ``philosophical'' to the wide (but far from all-inclusive) variety of issues, ideas, questions, etc., that we do apply it to. In most cases, probably, the discussions we call philosophical are similar in subject matter or methodology to the discussions had in academic philosophy. However, it's not obvious this is true in all cases. Even in the cases where it's true, it does not imply that the cultural DNA producing these discussions comes from academic philosophy. Moreover, it's not obvious how to describe the underlying principle (if there is one) of what questions are in the scope of what academic philosophy studies.

Let's use the term ``non-professional philosophy'' to refer to all philosophy done by people who are not professional philosophers working or studying at academic institutions of higher learning. This distinction is not meant to imply a hierarchical relationship where professional philosophy is superior to or more authoritative than non-professional philosophy.

To be sure, professional philosophers are usually better at philosophy than non-professional philosophers. Professional philosophers often cringe and sneer, for good reasons and bad reasons, at philosophical statements made by people who aren't professional philosophers. I see the idea that good philosophy only comes out of academic institutions as obviously silly. I also see the position that the academic institutions are mostly devoid of valuable philosophical thinking as obviously silly. My position is that philosophers should listen to anybody who seems to have good ideas about philosophy, and in discussions we should focus on what's being said rather than who's saying it.

The question remains, what is it that we call philosophy, that is practiced by both non-professional  and professional philosophers? To recall, our first stab at answering was to say that philosophy is an area of study concerned with principles that apply across many different domains of life, with fundamental and general questions about life, and with questions that can't be answered by any established methodology.

In refining our answer further, we could attempt to develop a theory of what philosophy is by gathering many examples of philosophy and looking to see what family resemblances they bear to each other. In doing this, we would run into instances where it wasn't clear whether something was or was not philosophy. To advance our project, we would need to adjudicate such questions. Eventually we might arrive at a good theory of what philosophy is, but inevitably (given my observation of how philosophical debates go) there would be objections to any theory put forth to answer this question.

We won't go in this direction. We're not going to undertake the project of understanding what philosophy is in general. Instead we will undertake the much leaner, more practical project of assembling a usable philosophy which contains the ideas that the author finds most practically and universally helpful in the wide variety of situations where philosophy is applicable. The ambition is to deliver the benefits of sound philosophy in a way whose applicability is as universal as possible.

As such, our focus largely is not on domain-specific philosophical issues, but on philosophical foundations. Specifically, we will organize our inquiry into four main areas: **language**, **reasoning**, **history**, and **values**.

Language is a major topic of study in modern philosophy. Language is at the center of many human activities, and most activities peculiar to the modern world. Think about the proportion of your day you spend processing language, including listening to words, reading, speaking, writing, and thinking using words. In my case, the answer is that I'm processing language almost all the time I'm awake, and that this is the locus of the vast majority of my activities.

Because of language's ubiquity, principles underlying the operation of language have very broad applicability. Language is the point of leverage in many productive philosophical techniques. Linguistic analysis is a crowbar that can pry open many philosophical insights. The principles of such linguistic philosophical analysis are one of the things we will pursue.

The second area is reasoning. This is an important area to discuss because principles of sound reasoning, applied to decision making, help us to excel in most areas of life. The study of reasoning, in essence, is mainly concerned with answering the question: what conclusions do a given set of premises or pieces of evidence support, and what kinds and degrees of uncertainty are present in the inferences that can be made?

Reasoning is so thoroughly related to language that it's impossible for us to discuss reasoning without discussing language. The study of reasoning provides an unusally clear context in which to discuss language, so that I have found it most useful to carry out the discussion of reasoning and language in parallel, as one topic: **language and reasoning**.

The third area is history. It is said that those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it. It is incumbent upon philosophical people to be the moral and historical conscience of society. This entails learning history, and applying appropriate methodologies to interpret it in ways that reveal the lessons that need to be learned from it.

Each of us lives in a small slice of time and space. If we're just concerned with the immediate problems facing us as individuals, then we don't need to know history. If we're concerned with understanding the world in general, then we need to know history. If we're concerned with understanding the present in general, then we need to know history. If we're concerned with being a voice in the guidance of our democratic process, then we need to know history so that we can understand the potential implications of policy proposals. Finally, and probably most importantly, history can play an important role in informing our values and our understanding of ourselves by giving us a sense of our context in the larger human journey and the journey of the Earth as a whole.

History, as I'm using the term, is the study of the past. This is different from how the term is used in academia. The academic field of history is the study of the past as revealed through written records. Many other academic fields also study the past. In my usage, "history" is the study of the past through all means available to us.

All information that we have comes from the past. When I look at my desk in front of me, I am looking at a model of the scene constructed by my brain (through a series of processing steps taking non-zero time) based on light that traveled (in non-zero time) from the desk to my eyes. I am looking at a picture of the past.

Similarly, the daily news is always about the past (but usually the recent past). Reading the news is an everyday way of studying history. This illustrates how close to home history often is.

In trying to study history, we're confronted with a pool of evidence consisting of nothing less than all information ever recorded. These are the clues left by the past. Interpreting them and constructing an understanding of what happened (or may have happened) is the work of history.

In this book, we will limit ourselves to the study of the methodology of history, and to the study of world history and selected narrower histories.

The main thing philosophy needs to provide for the study of history is a methodology for the study of history which leads us to the lessons of history in the most efficient and accurate way possible. This is of course not a new project; the methodology of history is a whole field of study. As always our aim is to synthesize past understanding on this topic, and to do it from a practical perspective, in this case with a view to revealing the lessons of history efficiently and accurately.

Of course, developing a methodology of history without showing how to apply it would be an absurd approach. This is why in addition to studying the methodology of history, we will do some history.

XXX: values

Before we go further, I want to provide some advice on reading philosophy, which applies to this text as well as other philosophical texts. If you're experienced at reading philosophy, you likely don't need this advice, but I hope that my audience includes people without much philosophy experience.

Philosophy is usually difficult to absorb and retain. For me, reading a philosophy text once at a normal reading speed is usually not enough to understand it. What usually works best for me is to go slowly, taking frequent breaks to think, and to go back over passages until I understand them, both within one sitting and over multiple sittings. The principle of this advice is to be patient, to give oneself space to think, and not to rush one's reading comprehension.

The main of this text will be devoted to the subjects we have outlined: language, reasoning, history, and value. However, I would be remiss to start a lesson on philosophy aimed at non-philosophers without placing it within the context of the broader philosophical conversation that has been happening for thousands of years. I would also betray my historical principles if I did not place our discussion in the context of the history of philosophy. Therefore, I will preface the main of the lesson with a brief history of philosophy.

The reader may have noticed the Western bias of the preceding discussion. The author is an American who lives in a Western society and has been trained in Western philosophy. I believe that Western philosophy should seek to learn lessons from and assimilate the best parts of the philosophies of the world. I have studied the philosophies of the world to some extent, but Western philosophy is what I know best. At this time I have not done the work necessary to integrate the best lessons of the philosophies of the world into my own philosophy. For this reason, this book has an unapologetically Western bias. Western philosophy is the subject, tradition, and paradigm of this book.

As such, our history of philosophy will be just a history of Western philosophy. The word "philosophy" is an English word derived from a Greek word. In that sense, philosophy is a Western concept. At the same time, entirely similar activities have been carried out around the world, for example in the Muslim world, and in India and China. The philosophical traditions of these non-Western cultures are the ones that will sadly be left out of our discussion, because of my lack of expertise to talk about them.
