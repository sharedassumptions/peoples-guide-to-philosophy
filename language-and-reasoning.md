## Introduction

### Introduction to Language

What is language? The term "language" encompasses written language and spoken language, including recordings of spoken language, and language in the form of synthesized speech.

Are non-pronounceable symbols, such as the internationally recognized [hazard symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_symbol), a form of language? What about smoke signals? Computer code? Morse code? Is any digitally recorded information a form of language? What about random bits recorded on a hard drive?

I find it likely the reader will agree that of the things mentioned in the previous paragraph, some are language and some aren't. I will leave the reader to consider these questions (and the [Sorites paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox) their series may or may not form) in more depth if they wish.

Getting deeper insight into what language is requires determining general principles and laws concerning language. There is so much language in the world that understanding language by exhaustive analysis of all existing language is blatantly impossible. Moreover, each of us has an enormous store of personal experience with language. Therefore, to discover general principles and laws concerning language, primarily we need to reflect on our own experiences and experiment with different generalizations, methods, and theoretical perspectives to find productive avenues to taming the great complexities of language.

Why understand language? If knowledge is power, then knowledge of language promises to be an extraordinarily useful form of power. Language dominates numerous aspects of life and it is the most common mechanism by which powerful people acquire and exercise their power.

Mathematics is to a significant extent the theoretical key to understanding, and therefore controlling, the natural world. In contrast, theory that enables us to understand language offers us the promise of controlling linguistic reality, turning words to our advantage in any kind of situation. Such a power, obviously, can be used for good or evil, which is one reason that philosophical people have a responsibility to concern themselves with ethics, as we will do later in this book, and to adhere to ethical principles as well as merely studying them.

In terms of the direction of this book, the reason for discussing language and discussing it first is that our understanding of language is the foundation for our understanding of reasoning, though we discuss them in an intertwined way for convenience.

Our understanding of language and reasoning provide the foundation for our understanding of history and the methodology of history. The reason for this foundational relationship is that history is at its core a task of gathering and analyzing information, where analyzing information means analyzing mostly linguistic data to determine its evidentiary significance in terms of what it says or might say about the past. History is an intellectual investigation which must employ philosophically sound principles of reasoning, and the biggest portion of the data to be analyzed is langague, which is why an understanding of language and reasoning is an important foundation for the philosophical pursuit of history.

These three areas, language, reasoning, and history, cumulatively provide the foundation for our analysis of decision making (which is inclusive of value and ethics). A thesis of this book is that our understanding of value, ethics, and other decision making factors is best founded on generalization from numerous historical and stereotypical case studies. The theory says that it's often easy to see in retrospect what things were good and bad, and that history shows us the consequences of various ways of thinking about decision making factors. We will get into all of this more later.

In short, the understanding of language is the first layer in a tower of foundations we're going to build. To put it simply, explaining language helps us explain reasoning (and also vice versa); explaining language and reasoning helps us explain history; and explaining language, reasoning, and history helps us explain value.

#### The technological perspective on language

There are many theoretical perspectives we can take on language. We will provide a history of the study of language which will introduce many of these perspectives. I will provide right now a theoretical perspective on language that I find particularly fruitful. This is to think of language as a form of technology.

What is technology? The simplest form of technology is a tool. A simple example of a tool is a stick that a primate uses to capture ants to eat. This simple example illustrates that a thing produced by nature, a stick, becomes a tool when it's used by an animal to accomplish a purpose. More sophisticated tools are also all made by animals from things found in nature. In the modern industrial world, tools are generally manufactured from natural resources with the help of a dizzying array of existing tools and other forms of technology.

There are many forms of technology that we wouldn't usually call tools, including books, satellites, medicines, etc. All of these things could plausibly be called tools. One loose way of using the word "tool" would be as a synonym for technology.

We can begin to see the plausibility of thinking of language as a kind of technology by reflecting on simple cases such as a hypothetical language given by Wittgenstein in the *Philosophical Investigations* (part I, remark 2), which we are here divorcing from its significance in the original context:

> The language is meant to serve for communication between a builder A and an assistant B. A is building with buildingstones: there are blocks, pillars, slabs and beams. B has to pass the stones, and that in the order in which A needs them. For this purpose they use a language consisting of the words "block", "pillar", "slab", "beam". A calls them out;—B brings the stone which he has learnt to bring at such-and-such a call.——Conceive this as a complete primitive language.

In this hypothetical language, the words "block," "pillar," "slab," and "beam" can easily be understood as tools that the construction workers are using to do their jobs. If we think of words as tools, then they are tiny tools which modern humans group together and deploy in highly complex ways to accomplish all kinds of purposes. Very little gets done in modern life without language, so if language is a toolset, then it is an extraordarily useful one.

Language is much more abstract than prototypical examples of tools like sticks and hammers. However, it's no less abstract than, say software. If it's a stretch for you to call language a toolset, you can call it a form of technology.

One might argue that a significant difference between language and prototypical examples of technology is that technology is a tangible product which exists in the material world, whereas language is more abstract, existing first and foremost as a skill set some animals have, and secondly as physical records of language which are however useless without language-competent animals to interpret them.

This alleged difference, I think, is less clearly existent when we consider the nature of technology more closely. Consider, for example, that all currently existing technology will eventually cease to function without human attendance, and that technology ceases to serve a purpose without animals to use it. Recorded language, on the other hand, ceases to serve a purpose without animals to derive meaning from it.

To further explore the similarities between language and other forms of technology, consider a computer algorithm (e.g., the [quicksort algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hHWpuAPBHo), or the [LZW compression algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch)). A computer algorithm is a form of technology. It can exist as an idea in somebody's head; as an idea on paper; as a working piece of code; as a patent; as a distributed product; etc. An algorithm is a kind of technology, but it's a kind of technology that seems to have a diffuse existence, being embodied in people's heads and on hard drives and as legal concepts and so on and so forth. In the respect of having a diffuse existence, an algorithm is very much like a word, which is typically embodied in countless utterances and written instances, and crucially in the understanding of the word of every person who knows it.

So far I have argued, in short, that **language is technology**. In other words, the category "technology" subsumes the category "language." I have described this categorical relationship as being a theoretical perspective on language. How is it a theoretical perspective, and not just an interesting, possibly contentious, and yet fairly unimportant statement of category inclusion?

The value of taking a technological perspective on language is that it ties the conversation on language firmly to practice and practical ends at all times. With technology, every [yak-shaving](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that.html) intellectual detour is ultimately tied back to some practical end. In the case of good technology, those bonds are firm and achieve a successful, tight feedback loop between theory and practice. That feedback loop is something we want out of a practical philosophy of language. We want our theory of language to be deeply informed by the real world of linguistic occurrences, and to yield dividends in practical applications of language in many areas.

We will find situations where thinking of language as technology which exists for practical reasons allows us to cut through a haze of philosophical confusions that might otherwise beset us. The important thing is that this way of thinking allows us to distinguish between questions about language that do and do not matter.

In my view this is especially critical to success in philosophy of language because there are no universal, binding rules concerning language use (everybody is master of their own speech), and without such rules it often proves impossible to get a foothold on philosophy of language questions that don't matter. The debate on whether hot dogs are sandwiches is an illustrative example.

Philosophy of language questions with practical significance, on the other hand, tend to be tractable. The reason for this, in my view, is that language is a toolset which we fit to the task, rather than the other way around. When dealing with practical questions, we easily recognize the need to fit language to the task and not try to fit reality to language. When dealing with questions that lack practical significance, there is little to check the temptation to pontificate on the internals of our personal or shared understanding of language in a style of discussion which can be very interesting but rarely leads to anything of value. Most debates in metaphysics illustrate this tendency, as do most debates in philosophy of language.

This is not to say that philosophy of language questions that matter are always tractable, or that tractable philosophy of language questions always matter. It's just to say that philosophy of language questions that don't matter have a non-exceptionless tendency to be intractable, and philosophy of language questions that do matter have a non-exceptionless tendency to be tractable. We should focus on the questions that matter, and we should attack even the most intractable questions when they are important enough to warrant the effort.

Beyond its marrying of philosophy of language to practicality, the value of the technological perspective on language is that it provides a metaphor which suggests that we apply concepts and intuitions that we apply to technology in general to the understanding of language. The reader can reflect on whether this provokes anything in them. We will unfold how this metaphor plays out in various theoretical contexts later on.

#### Linguistic normativity and linguistic descriptivism and prescriptivism

What normative rules exist concerning the use of language? This is a context-dependent question with many different answers. Here are some examples of normative rules concerning language use that have existed in various contexts:

* In the city-state of Ancient Athens, it was illegal for citizens to make statements denying the state religion.
* In some monasteries, it has been against the monastic code of conduct to speak at all except in extreme situations.
* In the times of the dominance of the Catholic Church, it has been illegal to contradict the positions of the Church.
* In various communist states including the USSR and North Korea, it has been illegal (or at least likely to lead to imprisonment) to state political positions contradicting the communist party's line.
* When writing an essay for school or a paper for an academic journal, generally there are various standards of grammar, spelling, citation convention, pronoun use, tone, etc. which are expected, with the consequence of violations usually being a lower likelihood of getting a good grade or getting published.
* In most modern Western societies, the idea of white supremacy is something which people are free to advocate, but censure, hatred, and social exclusion tends to follow people who do so, meaning there is extralegal normative social pressure against advocating such positions.

We can see that there are and have been many normative rules concerning language use, embodying many different forms and degrees of normativity, all particular to some social context. We can name no universal normative rule concerning language; i.e., we can name no normative rule concerning language use which applies to all social contexts in history. This is apparent reflecting on the diversity and lack of commonality of the languages and cultures that have existed.

In modern Western societies, we generally endorse a strong principle of freedom of speech, giving everybody the legal right to say almost anything they want (with [exceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater), including cases like [defamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation), [conspiracy to commit treason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason), and [copyright infringement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright)).

In a free speech society, naturally people are free to violate grammar rules, to spell and pronounce words however they want, and to use words to mean whatever they want them to mean. People are free to make false statements, nonsensical statements, and so forth. In short, *within* a free speech society, there are (almost) no universal normative rules concerning language use.

The existence, on the one hand, of normative rules of language use, and the lack of universal normative rules of language use in free speech societies and the world as a whole, provide the basis for a number of intellectual perspectives on language.

The first perspective is the perspective of linguistic prescriptivism. A linguistic prescriptivist sees themselves as a rulemaker for language, or as teacher and enforcer of rules of language handed down from original prescriptivists who wrote the rules. Original linguistic prescriptivists, i.e. authors of rules of language, can realize their vision of establishing and enforcing new norms of language use if their curriculum is enforced in public schools by decree of a government, and also if by consent within the free market of ideas they are able to achieve dominance of their prescribed language norms within some segment of the language universe.

The second perspective is the perspective of linguistic descriptivism. A linguistic descriptivist is somebody who sets about the task of describing how people use language. The descriptivist is concerned with how people *do* use language, as opposed to how they *should* use language. Therefore the descriptivist's task is to describe the regularities that exist in the language universe and its various parts, without the purpose of judging any language as good or bad.

Linguistic prescriptivists may have a role to play even in a free speech society. One can argue for example that it's helpful to teach children grammar, and that prescriptive rules are a useful educational tool in many or all cases. Prescriptivists are limited in free speech societies by, of course, free speech, which means in general everybody is free to ignore their rules. However, they can still achieve influence outside of educational institutions by consent, particularly if they manage to influence the influencers, i.e. influence the language styles of people who influence others' language styles. This will be the case if, for example, the prescriptivists educate those influencers and the influencers go on to stick with the patterns of language they were taught.

Linguistic descriptivism is the basic intellectual perspective of modern academic studies of language. To my knowledge, present-day academic researchers almost never claim to have the authority to define normative rules for language use in general (though they may for example claim to have authority over the usage by other academics of jargon words they coin, which is a very narrow and limited form of linguistic prescriptivism).

#### Pronunciation, spelling, and grammar

Pronunciation and spelling are basically uninteresting topics from a philosophical perspective. 

#### Declarative sentences

#### Meanings of words

#### Meanings of phrases and sentences
