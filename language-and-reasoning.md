# Language and Reasoning

What is language? The term "language" encompasses written language and spoken language, including recordings of spoken language, and language in the form of synthesized speech.

Are non-pronounceable symbols, such as the internationally recognized [hazard symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_symbol), a form of language? What about smoke signals? Morse code? Computer code? Is any digitally recorded information a form of language? What about random bits recorded on a hard drive?

I find it likely the reader will agree that of the things mentioned in the previous paragraph, some are language and some aren't. I will leave the reader to consider these questions in more depth if they wish.

Getting deeper insight into what language is requires determining general principles and laws concerning language. There is so much language in the world that understanding language by exhaustive analysis of all existing language is blatantly impossible. Moreover, each of us has an enormous store of personal experience with language. Therefore, to discover general principles and laws concerning language, primarily we need to reflect on our own experiences and experiment with different generalizations, methods, and theoretical perspectives to find productive avenues to taming the great complexities of language.

Why understand language? If knowledge is power, then knowledge of language promises to be an extraordinarily useful form of power. Language dominates numerous aspects of life and it is the most common mechanism by which powerful people acquire and exercise their power.

Mathematics is to a significant extent the theoretical key to understanding, and therefore controlling, the natural world. In contrast, theory that enables us to understand language offers us the promise of controlling linguistic reality, turning words to our advantage in any kind of situation. Such a power, obviously, can be used for good or evil, which is one reason that philosophical people have a responsibility to concern themselves with morals, as we will do later in this book.

In terms of the direction of this book, the reason for discussing language and discussing it first is that our understanding of language is the foundation for our understanding of reasoning, though we discuss them in an intertwined way for convenience.

Our understanding of language and reasoning provide the foundation for our understanding of history and the methodology of history. The reason for this foundational relationship is that history is at its core a task of gathering and analyzing information, where analyzing information means analyzing mostly linguistic data to determine its evidentiary significance in terms of what it says or might say about the past. History is an intellectual investigation which must employ philosophically sound principles of reasoning, and the biggest portion of the data to be analyzed is langague, which is why an understanding of language and reasoning is an important foundation for the philosophical pursuit of history.

These three areas, language, reasoning, and history, cumulatively provide the foundation for our analysis of value (which is inclusive of morals and ethics). A thesis of this book is that our understanding of value and related concepts is best founded on generalization from numerous historical and stereotypical case studies. The theory says that it's often easy to see in retrospect what things were good and bad, and that history shows us the consequences of various ways of thinking about various concerns related to value. We will get into all of this more later of course.

In short, the understanding of language is the first layer in a tower of foundations we're going to build. To put it simply, explaining language helps us explain reasoning (and also vice versa); explaining language and reasoning helps us explain history; and explaining language, reasoning, and history helps us explain value.
